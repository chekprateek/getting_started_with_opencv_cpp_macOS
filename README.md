# Setting Up OpenCV with C++17 on macOS

This guide outlines how to install and set up OpenCV with C++17 support on macOS, using Homebrew for package management, `clang++` for compiling, and Sublime Text as the editor.

## Prerequisites

1. **Homebrew**: macOS package manager for easy installation of software packages.
2. **OpenCV**: Computer vision library.
3. **clang++**: C++ compiler (comes with macOS Xcode Command Line Tools).
4. **Sublime Text**: Text editor (or any preferred code editor).

### Step 1: Install Homebrew

Homebrew is required for installing OpenCV and other necessary dependencies. To install Homebrew, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Step 2: Install OpenCV with Homebrew

OpenCV can be easily installed via Homebrew. Run the following command to install the latest version of OpenCV (OpenCV 4.x):

```bash
brew install opencv
```

Once the installation is complete, you can verify that OpenCV is installed correctly by checking its version:

```bash
brew info opencv
```

This will provide information about the OpenCV installation path and related files.

### Step 3: Install Clang (if not already installed)

macOS includes `clang` as part of its developer tools.

You can verify the `clang++` version by running:

```bash
clang++ --version
```

Ensure that it shows `clang++ version 11.0.0` or higher, which supports C++11, C++14, and C++17.

### Step 4: Install Sublime Text (Optional)

Sublime Text is a popular text editor for coding. If you donâ€™t have it installed, you can install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask sublime-text
```

Alternatively, you can download it directly from [Sublime Text's website](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

### Step 5: Write Your OpenCV C++ Code

Open Sublime Text (or your preferred editor), and create a new C++ file (e.g., `main.cpp`). An example code to stream through your webcam is in main.cpp

### Step 6: Compile Your Code

To compile your code using `clang++`, use the following command:

```bash
clang++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o webcam_stream `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
```

Explanation:
- `clang++`: Invokes the C++ compiler.
- `-std=c++17`: Specifies to use the C++17 standard.
- `main.cpp`: Your source file.
- `-o webcam_stream`: Specifies the output executable name.
- `` `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4` ``: Provides the necessary OpenCV flags for compiling and linking.

### Step 7: Run the Program

Once compiled, you can run the program with:

```bash
./webcam_stream
```

Press the **'q'** key to close the webcam window and stop the program.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with the `pkg-config` command, try reinstalling OpenCV with Homebrew or verifying that OpenCV's `pkg-config` file is correctly installed.
- Ensure that the OpenCV installation is linked correctly by checking that `pkg-config` points to the correct directories (usually `/opt/homebrew/opt/opencv` on Apple Silicon or `/usr/local/opt/opencv` on Intel-based Macs).

Feel free to adjust these instructions according to your specific setup or preferences. If any errors pop up during compilation or execution, don't hesitate to contact me for further assistance.

# Some Fun Projects 

Inside opencv_fun_projects folder contains some cpp files that serves an educational purpose as follows 

### luma_chroma_channel.cpp

Human eyes are more sensitive to luminance than to chrominance. This project demonstrates how the majority of visual information we care about is contained in the luminance channel (Y) by displaying the Y, Cb, and Cr channels separately alongside the RGB video. This highlights an important principle behind JPEG compression: most of the significant data comes from the luminance channel, which is retained and transformed into Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. Meanwhile, the chrominance channels (Cb and Cr) are often downsampled to reduce the data size, exploiting the fact that the human eye is less sensitive to color differences.


### classical_haar_cascade_face_hand_detection.cpp

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier. The algorithm captures video from your webcam, processes each frame, and detects faces in the image. Once a face is detected, a green bounding box is drawn around the face to highlight it. The face detection works by converting each frame to grayscale (since the Haar Cascade works on grayscale images) and then applying the detectMultiScale() method to find faces.
